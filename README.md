Background: 
Flight Data Recorders are installed to record flight activities and data displayed on the panel with the instrument gauges. Analyzing this video data can provide insight on what causes rotorcraft accidents so that the risk of occurrence can be mitigated. This is important as rotorcrafts have one of the highest accident rates!The goal of the project is to use Artificial Intelligence to predict the value of airspeed gauge from the video data of a cokcpit. The repoistory includes a csv file (Timestamps & Corresponding Air Speed Values) as well was the code for data preparation and neural network.


Purpose:
The goal of the project is to use Deep Learning (Image Classification) to predict the value of the airspeed gauge from the video data of a cokcpit. The repoistory includes a csv file (Timestamps & Corresponding Air Speed Values) as well was the code for data preparation and neural network.
